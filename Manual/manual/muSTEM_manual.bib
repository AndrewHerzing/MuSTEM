  Abstract                 = {Abstract While the computational complexity of calculation of the projected potential in the multislice algorithm through reciprocal space scales quadratically with the number of atoms A per slice, a pure real-space calculation scales linearly with A. A hybrid strategy is introduced that has a theoretical complexity of O ( A log A ) , but that, when measured, outperforms both the reciprocal-space and the real-space approach by approximately an order in A and a large factor, respectively. This strategy is implemented in a new program, dubbed forward dynamical electron scattering (FDES), which simulates high resolution transmission electron microscopy images, diffraction patterns and convergent beam electron diffraction patterns. \{FDES\} attains a further increase in speed by running on a graphics processing unit and is made available to the community as open software. },
